## Generating a Kolmogorov-Waring model

In order to create a Kolmogorov-Waring model you will use the `Generalized_Kolmogorov_Waring(n, a, b, theta)` function. The parameter `n` indicates the length of the vector. Parameters `a` and `b` take in numeric vectors. Parameter `theta` takes in a numeric. `a` `b` and `theta` provide the birth-death process parameters for the KW function.

```{r}
model <- Kolmogorov_Waring(10, 1, 2, 0.9); model
length(model)
```

We can see that the output length is actually `n+1` this is because p0 is included at index 1 of the vector. 

## Fitting a Kolmogorov-Waring model
