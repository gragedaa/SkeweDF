## About

This package contains a family of skewed distribution functions based on Kolmogorov birth-death process models. These functions have been implemented such that the models are returned as discrete numeric vectors. Fitting functions and helper functions have also been included.

## Installation 

```
devtools::install_github('gragedaa/SkeweDF')
```

## Usage

Please refer to `./vignettes/using_kw_functions.Rmd` to see some examples where Kolmogorov-Waring models are used.
